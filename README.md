# Element selector

Select an existing element on the page. While might seem niche, Iâ€™ve lost count of how many times I had to reimplement this functionality over the years.

**User flow:**

1. Click the purple button in the bottom-right corner.
2. You are now in element select mode. Hover over page elements and enjoy fancy effects (it's `box-shadow` with a huge spread-radius btw.).
3. 'Click' some page element to select it.
4. The button in the bottom-right corner turns into a popup with data about the selected element.

## Usage

1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start` <- dev server
1. Go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

**Other commands:**

- `yarn build`. Builds prod version into `build`.
- `yarn preview`. Builds prod version into `build`, starts [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
- `yarn clean`. Remove all files from `build`.
- `yarn lint`. Runs linter. It's a small project, but I have no patience to deal with raw JS.

And if I forget yarn commands again: [Yarn recipes](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/recipes).
